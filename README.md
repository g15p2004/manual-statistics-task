 Manual Statistics Task

Objective
The goal of this task was to perform basic statistical calculations (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and probability) manually and present the handwritten work.

 Dataset
Test scores used:
78, 85, 92, 67, 88, 73, 95, 81, 76, 89, 90, 84

 Calculations
- Mean ≈ 83.17
- Median = 84.5
- Variance ≈ 64.36
- Standard Deviation ≈ 8.02
- Probability of score > 90 = 16.7%

Learnings
- Reinforced understanding of core statistical measures.
- Realized how variance and standard deviation capture the spread of data.
- Saw the importance of organizing data (sorting) when finding the median.
- Manual calculation helped me appreciate tools like Python/Excel more!
